====== Windows ======
You'll need Visual Studio (only tested with 2010).

- Get the binary build of wxWidgets 2.9.4 for your platform from
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/2.9.4/binaries/

  - For 32bit builds, you need the following files:
    - wxWidgets-2.9.4_Headers.7z
    - wxMSW-2.9.4-vc100_Dev.7z
    - wxMSW-2.9.4_vc100_ReleaseDLL.7z
    - wxMSW-2.9.4_vc100_ReleasePDB.7z

  - Unpack all files into the same directory so that "include" and "lib" directories are at the same level after unpacking.
  - Set a new environment variable WXWIN=C:\wxWidgets-2.9.4 (replace the path with the path where you unpacked wxWidgets).
  - If you want to run the binaries without using the installer, add %WXWIN% to your path. 
- Download and install CMake for Windows (www.cmake.org)
- Open a command prompt and change into the directory where you unpacked the TrenchBroom sources.
- Create a new directory, e.g. "build", and change into it.
- Run the following two commands
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  cmake --build . --config Release
  You can replace "Release" with "Debug" if you want to create a debug build.


====== Linux ======
Dependencies
Compiling wxWidgets 2.9 requires the following dependencies. You should install them using the packager of your Linux distribution.
- g++ GNU c++ compiler
- GTK2 and development packages: libgtk2.0-dev (GTK3 will NOT work)
- OpenGL and GLU development headers (Mesa OpenGL development packages)
  freeglut3, freeglut3-dev, mesa-common-dev
- X11 video mode extension library: libxxf86vm-dev
- If you have a debian-based distribution, install them with this command:
  sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev freeglut3 freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev libxxf86vm-dev
Compiling and linking TrenchBroom requires a working OpenGL installation. This page may help you if you see linker errors about missing GL libraries:

wxWidgets
- Get the latest sources of wxWidgets 2.9 from wxwidgets.org and unpack them.
- Move the unpacked directory someplace where you want to keep it.
- Open a terminal and change into the wxwidgets directory.
- Create two directories: build-release and build-debug (don't rename those!)
- Change into wxwidgets/build-release
- Run 
  ../configure --disable-shared --with-opengl --with-gtk=2
- Run make
- Run sudo make install
- Change into wxwidgets/build-debug
- Run 
  ../configure --enable-debug --disable-shared --with-opengl --with-gtk=2
- Run make
- Run sudo make install

CMake
- Install CMake using your package manager: sudo apt-get install cmake

- Open a terminal and change into the directory where you unpacked the TrenchBroom sources
- Create a new directory, e.g. "build", and change into it.
- Run the following two commands
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  cmake --build .
  You can replace "Release" with "Debug" if you want to create a debug build.
