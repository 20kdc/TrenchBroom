Build environment

1. wxWidgets
- Get the latest sources of wxWidgets 2.9 from wxwidgets.org and unpack them.
- Move the unpacked directory someplace where you want to keep it.
- Open a terminal and change into the wxwidgets directory.
- Create two directories: macbuild and macbuild-debug (don't rename those!)
- Change into wxwidgets/macbuild
- Run 
  ../configure --with-osx_cocoa --disable-shared --with-opengl --enable-universal-binary=i386,x86_64
- Run make (don't run make install!)
- Change into wxwidgets/macbuild-debug
- Run 
  ../configure --enable-debug --with-osx_cocoa --disable-shared --with-opengl --enable-universal-binary=i386,x86_64
- Run make (don't run make install!)
- Create a link from TrenchBroom/Mac/wxWidgets to your wxWidgets directory, e.g.
  ln -s ~/Documents/Code/XCode/wxWidgets-2.9.4 ~/Documents/Code/XCode/TrenchBroom/Mac/wxWidgets
