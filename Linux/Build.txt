Build environment

1. wxWidgets
- Compiling wxWidgets 2.9 requires the following dependencies. You should install them using the packager of your Linux distribution.
  - g++ GNU c++ compiler
  - GTK2 and development modules
  - OpenGL and GLU development headers (Mesa OpenGL development packages)
- Get the latest sources of wxWidgets 2.9 from wxwidgets.org and unpack them.
- Move the unpacked directory someplace where you want to keep it.
- Open a terminal and change into the wxwidgets directory.
- Create two directories: build-release and build-debug (don't rename those!)
- Change into wxwidgets/build-release
- Run 
  ../configure --disable-shared --with-opengl
- Run make (don't run make install!)
- Change into wxwidgets/build-debug
- Run 
  ../configure --enable-debug --disable-shared --with-opengl
- Run make (don't run make install!)
- Create a global variable named "WXWIN" in Code::Blocks (Menu > Settings > Global Variables...)
  and set its base field to point to your wxWidgets directory
