1. Perform the following steps in any order:
	- Build Windows binary, then commit changes.
	- Build Mac binary, then commit changes.
	- Build Linux binary, then commit changes.

	Do not forget to commit the changes, which are a result of the automatic increase of the build no.

2. Update the repository:
	- If the build is a new release (major or minor version no increase), then create a new branch for it. The name of the branch should be Release_<major>.<minor>.0
	- If the build is a maintenance release, then create a tag for it in the appropriate branch. The name of the tag should be Release_<major>.<minor>.<maintenance>
	- Switch back to the master branch and update the version numbers for all build configurations. Commit these changes.

3. Publish the binaries
	- Rename the zip files containing the binaries like so: TrenchBroom_<platform>_<major>.<minor>.<maintenance>.zip where <platform> is one of "Win32", "Mac" or "Linux".
	- Upload the zip files to the appropriate sub directories on the website.
	- Announce the release on func, inside3d, and quakeone.com.
