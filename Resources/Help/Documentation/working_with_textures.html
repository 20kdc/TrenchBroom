		<h2>Working With Textures</h2>

		<a name="applying_textures"></a><h3>Applying Textures</h3>

		<a name="applying_textures"></a><h3>Applying Textures</h3>
		<p>You can assign new textures to faces in two ways: Selecting the texture for the currently selected faces in the texture browser or using the mouse. To assign a texture using the first way, select the faces you want to assign the texture to in the 3D view and then click on the texture in the texture browser. If you select entire brushes in the 3D view, the texture will be assigned to all faces of the selected brushes.</p>

		<p>The second way is useful if you want to copy the texture of an existing face to other faces. First, select the face whose texture you want to copy in the 3D view. This face is called the <b>source face</b>. Then <b>left click</b> on the target faces you wish to copy the texture to while holding the <b>option key (&#x2325;)</b>. If you double click while holding the option key, the texture is applied on each face of the brush to which the target face belongs.</p>
		<p>In the next section, you will learn how you can use this technique to not only copy the texture and the attributes of an existing face to other faces.</p>

		<a name="changing_face_attributes"></a><h3>Changing Face Attributes</h3>
		<p>The attributes of a face are the horizontal and vertical offsets and scaling factors as well as the rotation of the texture. To examine the attributes of a face, you must first select it in the 3D view. The <a href="">quick view bar</a> at the bottom of the 3D view displays the attributes of the selected face(s) in its very right section:</p>
		<div class="images">
			<img src="../../shrd/quick_view_bar_attributes.png" width="592" height="97" alt="Face Attributes in the Quick View Bar">
			<div class="imagecaption">The quick view bar allows you to inspect the face attributes.</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>The other way to inspect the attributes of the selected face(s) is to switch to the <b>Face</b> tab of the inspector. Here, you can also manipuate the attributes by entering new values or by using the small up / down buttons next to the text fields.</p>
		<div class="images">
			<img src="../../shrd/inspector_face_attributes.png" width="401" height="185" alt="Face Attributes in the Inspector">
			<div class="imagecaption">The face inspector allows you to manipulate the face attributes.</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>The second way to manipulate the attributes of the selected face(s) is to use the appropriate menu commands in the <b>Edit</b> menu, the <b>Edit &raquo; Texture</b> submenu or their respective keyboard shortcuts. The following list details each of the commands:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Edit &raquo; Move Left (<b>&#x2190;</b>)</b> - decreases the horizontal texture offset by the current grid size</li>
			<li><b>Edit &raquo; Move Right (<b>&#x2192;</b>)</b> - increases the horizontal texture offset by the current grid size</li>
			<li><b>Edit &raquo; Move Up (<b>&#x2191;</b>)</b> - increases the vertical texture offset by the current grid size</li>
			<li><b>Edit &raquo; Move Down (<b>&#x2193;)</b></b> - decreases the vertical texture offset by the current grid size</li>
			<li><b>Edit &raquo; Texture &raquo; CW Left By 15 (<b>U</b>)</b> - rotates the texture left by 15&deg; (&#x2325;: 1 degree)</li>
			<li><b>Edit &raquo; Texture &raquo; CCW Right By 15 (<b>O</b>)</b> - rotates the texture right by 15&deg; (&#x2325;: 1 degree)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To move the texture by 1 instead of the current grid size or to rotate the texture by 1&deg; instead of 15&deg;, hold the <b>option key (&#x2325;)</b> while invoking these commands.</p>
		<p>Besides copying the texture of the selected face to other faces, you can also use the mouse to copy face attributes. Simply hold the <b>command key (&#x2318;)</b> while clicking on another face and along with the texture, the attributes of the source face are copied to the target face you clicked on.</p>









		TrenchBroom allows you to <a href="#moving_objects">move</a>, <a href="#rotation_objects">rotate</a> and <a href="#flipping_objects">flip</a> objects. All properties of faces and entities can be changed using the inspector. Of course, you can also delete objects.
		
		<a name="moving_objects"></a><h3>Moving Objects</h3>
		<p>You can either move objects using the cursor keys or the mouse. The <script>print_key("Left");</script> and <script>print_key("Right");</script> cursor keys move the selected objects left or right on the XY plane whereas the <script>print_key("Up");</script> and <script>print_key("Down");</script> keys move them towards or away from the camera. To move objects vertically, use the <script>print_key("PgUp");</script> or <script>print_key("PgDown");</script> key.</p>
		<div class="images">
			<img src="images/move_objects_xy.jpg" width="600" height="553" alt="Moving Objects" id="move_objects" />
			<div class="imagecaption">Moving objects with the mouse.</div>
		</div>
		<p>To move the selected objects horizontally using the mouse, <b>click and drag</b> the objects with the <b>left mouse button</b>. To move them vertically, hold the <script>print_key("Alt");</script> while dragging. The movement direction is indicated with little arrow heads next to the cursor.</p>
		<p>If grid snapping is enabled, the objects are moved by multiples of the grid size.</p>

		<a name="rotating_objects"></a><h3>Rotating Objects</h3>
		<p>There are two options for rotating objects. The first is to rotate the selected brushes by 90&deg; about the one of the axes of the coordinate system. The second is to rotate the selected objects freely using the mouse. In both cases, the center of the rotation is the center of the selected objects' bounding box. If grid snapping is enabled, the rotation center is snapped to the grid.</p>
		<p>To rotate the selected objects by 90&deg; clockwise about one of the axes of the coordinate system, choose one of the rotation commands from the <b>Edit &raquo; Actions</b> menu or hit the appropriate keyboard shortcut. The following rotation commands are available:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Rotate 90&deg; CW (<script>print_key("Up", "CmdCtrl");</script>)</b> - roll the selected objects clockwise about the closest axis of the camera direction by 90&deg;.</li>
			<li><b>Rotate 90&deg; CCW (<script>print_key("Down", "CmdCtrl");</script>)</b> - roll the selected objects counter-clockwise about the closest axis of the camera direction by 90&deg;.</li>
			<li><b>Rotate 90&deg; Left (<script>print_key("Left", "CmdCtrl");</script>)</b> - rotate the selected objects counter-clockwise about the Z axis by 90&deg;.</li>
			<li><b>Rotate 90&deg; Right (<script>print_key("Right", "CmdCtrl");</script>)</b> - rotate the selected objects clockwise about the Z axis by 90&deg;.</li>
			<li><b>Rotate 90&deg; Up (<script>print_key("PgUp", "CmdCtrl");</script>)</b> - rotate the selected objects clockwise about the closest axis of the camera right axis by 90&deg;.</li>
			<li><b>Rotate 90&deg; Down (<script>print_key("PgDown", "CmdCtrl");</script>)</b> - rotate the selected objects counter-clockwise about the closest axis of the camera right axis by 90&deg;.</li>
		</ul>
		<br clear="all">
		<p>Objects can also be rotated freely without any restriction as to the angle or axis of the rotation. To rotate the selected objects, activate the rotate tool by choosing <script>print_menu_command("edit_rotate_tool");</script>. You will see a rotate handle displayed approximately at the center of the bounding box of the selected objects.</p>
		<div class="images">
			<img src="images/rotate_tool_1.jpg" width="600" height="553" alt="Rotating Objects" id="rotate_objects" />
			<div class="imagecaption">Rotating objects with the mouse.</div>
		</div>

		<p>The rotate handle consists of three quarter rings, each of which lets you rotate the selected objects about either the X,Y or Z axis. To start the rotation, <b>click and drag the left mouse button</b> on of the rings. Note that the rotation angle is constrained to 15&deg; increments if grid snap is enabled. Disable grid snap to rotate the selected objects without any constraints.</p>

		<a name="flipping_objects"></a><h3>Flipping Objects</h3>
		<p>The selected objects can be flipped (or mirrored) horizontally by choosing <script>print_menu_command("edit_flip_horizontally");</script> from the menu. To flip the selected objects vertically, choose <script>print_menu_command("edit_flip_vertically");</script> from the menu.</p>

		<a name="deleting_objects"></a><h3>Deleting Objects</h3>
		<p>To delete brushes or entities, select them in the 3D view and hit the <script>print_key("Delete");</script> key.</p>

		<a name="using_the_entity_property_editor"></a><h3>Using the Entity Property Editor</h3>
		<p>Each Quake entity has some properties associated with it. These properties control the appearance or the effect of an entity in the game. Each property has a key and a value. In TrenchBroom, these properties can be edited using property list in the entity inspector. The property list represents all properties of the selected entities.</p>
		<div class="images">
			<img src="../../shrd/inspector_entity_properties.png" width="401" height="348" alt="Entity Properties in the Inspector">
			<div class="imagecaption">The property list allows you to edit the properties of the selected entities.</div>
		</div>
		<p>To edit the key or the value of a property, simply <b>double click</b> it and enter the new key or value in the entity inspector. Hit <b>return (&#x21A9;)</b> to commit the changes. To create a new property, click on the <b>plus button</b> below the property list. To delete one or more properties, select them in the list and click on the <b>minus button</b> below the property list. Note that you can also edit the properties of multiple selected entities at once. However, only those properties are displayed in the list which all selected entities have in common.</p>
