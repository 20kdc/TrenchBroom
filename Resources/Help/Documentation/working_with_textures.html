		<h2>The Face Tab</h2>
		<p>This is where all texture information is displayed.  Here, you can select which texture to apply to the selection as well as the texture's offsets, rotation and scaling.</p>

			<h3>Texture Alignment Section</h3>
			<p>This part of the Face Tab is where texture alignment is handled. On the left is a large preview of the texture and on the right you can modify the offset, scale and rotation of the current selection (see <a href="WHAT PAGE WILL THIS BE???">this section on face selection</a> for how to control this).  You can enter values directly, or you can use the spinner controls to increment/decrement the values.  The intervals of these spinners have default values but change based on conditions.</p>
			<!-- clear left float for the unordered list so that it always appears below the image -->
			<ul style="clear:left;">
				<li>For texture offsets, clicking the spinner buttons will offset the texture by the current grid size.  Pressing <script>print_key("Shift");</script> while clicking the spinner will offset the texture by 2X the grid size.  Pressing <script>print_key("CmdCtrl");</script> while clicking the spinner will always offset the texture by 1 unit.</li>
				<li>For texture scaling, pressing the spinner buttons will scale the texture in increments of 0.1.  <script>print_key("Shift");</script> increases this to 0.25 and <script>print_key("CmdCtrl");</script> reduces this to 0.01.</li>
				<li>For texture rotation, the default value of angle changes is 15&#176;.  Pressing <script>print_key("Shift");</script> increases this value to 90&#176;. <script>print_key("CmdCtrl");</script> reduces this value to 1&#176; increments.</li>

			<img src="./images/faceTab_bot.png" width="352" alt="Face Tab, Texture Browser" class="inline" style="border-top:0px;margin-top:0px;">
			<h3>Texture Browser</h3>
			<p>This is where textures from all the WAD files currently in use are displayed.</p>
			<p>At the very top of this section are options that control how the textures are displayed in the browser.</p>
			<p>The first control on the left is a drop down list that allows you to sort textures either by <b>Name</b> or by <b>Usage</b>. Sorting by Name is fairly simple, it sorts the textures alphabetically.  Sorting by <b>Usage</b> is a little more interesting and sorts textures based on how often they are used in the map.  A common wall texture therefore appears first in the list while the more rarely used textures appear near the bottom (and unused textures are last).  This is extremely useful at the beginning of a map where you will need the entire wad open, and are still in the process of assembling your 'palette' of textures.</p>
			<p>The next control, <b>Group</b>, is a toggle button.  It changes the texture browser to display textures grouped together based on what WAD file they belong to (the wad files are sorted based on the order they are loaded).</p>
			<p>The third control, <b>Used</b>, is another toggle button.  When enabled, this filters out textures that are not used in the map.  This is very useful when you are satisfied with the current texture palette and no longer need to add new ones into the mix.  This ensures only textures already in the map are available for selection.</p>
			<p>The final control is a search box that dynamically filters textures based on their name.  If you are looking for liquids, typing "*" will show only textures who's names start with the "*" character, for example: "*water1, *water2, *lava".  You could also filter with "wat" which would return only "*water1, *water2".  The little X button on the right will clear the currently typed filter.</p>
