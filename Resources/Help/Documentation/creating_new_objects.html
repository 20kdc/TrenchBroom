		<h2>Creating New Objects</h2>
		<p>There are several ways to create new brushes and entities. It is recommended that you try all of the methods explained below because it depends on the context which one is most useful. In other words, sometimes it is quicker to simply duplicate an existing brush and sometimes it is quicker to create a new brush from scratch. In the next section, you will learn how to draw new brushes with your mouse, which is the most convenient way to create new geometry.</p>
		<h3>The Editing Plane</h3>
        <p>It is very important that you understand how mouse input is mapped to 3D coordinates when editing objects in TrenchBroom. Since the mouse is a 2D input device, you cannot directly control all three dimensions when you edit objects with the mouse. For example, if you want to move a brush around, you can only move it in two directions by dragging it. Because of this, TrenchBroom maps all mouse input to the horizontal XY plane. This means that you can only move things around horizontally by default. To move an object vertically (and left or right), you need to hold the <script>print_key("Alt");</script> key during editing.</p>

		<a id="drawing_new_brushes_using_the_mouse"></a><h3>Drawing New Brushes Using the Mouse</h3>
		<p>Creating a new brush from scratch is easily done in TrenchBroom. Simply <b>left click</b> and <b>drag</b> your mouse on the 3D view to create a new cuboid. While the mouse button is held down, you can move your mouse to resize the brush along two axes and your can spin the <b>mouse wheel</b> to resize along the third axis.</p>
		<p>The position and orientation of the new brush depends on where you started to draw it. If you started in the void, it is positioned at a default distance from the camera. If you started your drag on another brush, it is positioned on that brush's surface at the point where you clicked. You can only draw a new brush if you deselect everything first.</p>

		<p>Note that TrenchBroom automatically selects the most recently used texture when you draw a brush. The most recently used texture updated whenever you select a face or when you select a texture in the texture browser. A red border is drawn around that texture in the browser. <a href="misc_tasks.html#managing_textures">Click here</a> to find out more about texture management in TrenchBroom.</p>

		<!--<a id="inserting_prefabs"></a><h3>Inserting Prefabs</h3>
		<p>TrenchBroom comes with a selection of predefined prefabs which you can insert into your maps. To insert a prefab, switch to the <b>Brush</b> tab of the inspector and double click on the prefab you wish to insert. The prefab will be inserted in front of the camera. Be aware that some of the textures which are used by the prefab may not be available in your map. If that is the case, you must load the appropriate texture wads in the texture manager.</p>-->

		<a id="dragging_entities_from_the_entity_browser"></a><h3>Dragging Entities From The Entity Browser</h3>
		<p>The easiest way to create a new point entity is to drag it from the entity browser. Switch to the <b>Entity</b> tab of the inspector to reveal the entity browser and find the entity you wish to insert. Now <b>click</b> this entity with the <b>left mouse button</b> and <b>drag</b> it into the 3D view. Once your mouse cursor enters the 3D view, the entity will be created and positioned on the surface of the brush under the mouse cursor. Keep dragging until it is correctly placed and release it. Note that if there is nothing under the mouse cursor, the entity will be positioned at a default distance to the camera.</p>

		<a id="creating_point_and_brush_entities"></a><h3>Creating Point and Brush Entities</h3>
		<p>You can create any type of entity by using the popup menu of the 3D view. To create a new point entity, <b>right click</b><script>print_macCtrlClick();</script> in the 3D view and select the entity you wish to create from the <b>Create Point Entity</b> submenu. If you clicked on a brush when you opened the popup menu, the entity will be placed on the surface of that brush. If you clicked in the void, it will be placed at a default distance from the camera.</p>

		</div>
		<p>If you wish to create a brush entity, select the brushes that should belong to that entity, <b>right click</b><script>print_macCtrlClick();</script> in the 3D view and select the brush entity from the <b>Create Brush Entity</b> submenu. Note that you can only create a brush entity if none of the currently selected brushes belongs to any other brush entity (other than worldspawn).</p>

		<a id="duplicating_objects"></a><h3>Duplicating Objects</h3>
		<p>It is often very useful to create new objects by duplicating existing objects. You can duplicate brushes and entities by selecting them and choosing <b>Edit &raquo; Duplicate</b> from the menu or hitting <script>print_key("D", "CmdCtrl");</script>. The duplicated objects are offset by the current grid size towards the camera. Since TrenchBroom automatically selects the duplicates, you can edit them right away.</p>

		<a id="copy_and_paste"></a><h3>Copy and Paste</h3>
		<p>Just like in any other application, you can copy, cut and paste entities and brushes in TrenchBroom. Pasted objects are inserted in front of the camera at a default distance. Note that the copied objects are placed on the clipboard as text snippets in the standard map format. This means that you can copy objects in TrenchBroom and paste them into a text editor and vice versa. <!--Note also that you can paste objects in the original position they were in when they were copied to the clipboard if you hold the <b>option key (&#x2325;)</b> while pasting.--></p>
